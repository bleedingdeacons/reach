/**
 * Email + password authentication, plus the emailed set/reset flow.
 *
 * This is the second sign-in path alongside OAuth. It deliberately proves
 * only "this caller knows the password for this email" — exactly as an
 * OAuth provider proves "this caller controls this email" — and returns a
 * {@see VerifiedIdentity}. Whether that identity is *allowed* into Reach
 * (the 12th-stepper / telephone-responder gate) is decided by the REST
 * controller, keeping this class free of HTTP and authorisation concerns.
 *
 * Security posture:
 *   - Passwords are hashed with Argon2id ({@see password_hash()} with
 *     {@see PASSWORD_ARGON2ID}, OWASP baseline parameters), falling back to
 *     the platform default only where Argon2id isn't compiled in. Hashes are
 *     rehashed transparently on login when the algorithm/parameters move on.
 *   - The chosen password must satisfy {@see PasswordPolicy} (length-based,
 *     NIST SP 800-63B / NCSC style, no composition rules, common/context
 *     passwords rejected).
 *   - A wrong password and an email with no password behave identically,
 *     including running a throwaway {@see password_verify()} so the two
 *     can't be told apart by response timing (no account enumeration).
 *   - Per-account lockout after {@see MAX_FAILED_ATTEMPTS} failures.
 *   - Reset tokens are random 32-byte values mailed in the clear but
 *     stored only as a SHA-256 hash, single-use and 60-minute expiry.
 *   - A reset link is issued only for an eligible member; a request for
 *     any other address is a silent no-op so the caller can respond
 *     identically either way.
 *
 * A member's credential is GDPR-protected personal data: sign-ins and
 * password changes are audit-logged by the REST controller, and the stored
 * row is purged when the member is deleted (see Plugin bootstrap).
