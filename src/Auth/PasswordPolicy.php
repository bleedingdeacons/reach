 * Password strength policy, following modern guidance rather than the old
 * "must contain uppercase, lowercase, number and symbol" composition rules.
 *
 * The relevant guidance is NIST SP 800-63B (§5.1.1.2) and the UK NCSC
 * password guidance, which converge on:
 *
 *   - A sensible *minimum* length (NIST floor: 8) and a generous *maximum*
 *     (NIST: accept at least 64) — length beats composition. Longer
 *     pass-phrases of a few random words are encouraged.
 *   - NO composition rules and NO periodic forced rotation.
 *   - Accept all printable characters, spaces and Unicode; never truncate.
 *     Length is measured in Unicode code points.
 *   - Reject passwords that are known to be weak: common/breached passwords
 *     and context-specific values (here, the member's email and the site
 *     name), which an attacker guesses first.
 *
 * The check is deliberately offline: a compact deny-list of the most common
 * passwords plus context terms. It is the single source of truth for what
 * Reach considers an acceptable secret; {@see PasswordAuthenticator} calls
 * it when a member sets or resets a password.
